The assignment of [The Odin Project online course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-inventory-application) was to build an Express app connected to a database.
I decided on an Express/Node app for saving info about music tracks like key, mood and bpm and matching tracks.

## Used Technologies

- Express, Node, EJS, express-validator
- HTML/CSS/JS

## Features

- Track infos saved on SQL Database
- Validation and sanitizing of user input
- Add new track info and change existing track info
- Filter track list by key or mood
- Search for tracks by title or artist
- Responsive design

## Future Features

- Sort track list by key, mood, artist or title
- Add double drops and matching songs to a track
- Option to display cover art of track through API (e.g. Spotify API)
